# iHam

iHam (“interactive HOG Analysis Method’) is an interactive javascript tool based on the [TnT library](tntvis.github.io/tnt) to visualise the evolutionary history of a specific gene family (HOGs). It is used in the [OMA browser](http://omabrowser.org) and merely requires as input HOGs in the standard OrthoXML format (Schmitt et al. 2011), the underlying species tree in newick format and optionally gene family information in JSON format (see below for examples).
